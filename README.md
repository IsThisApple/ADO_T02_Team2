Simulating F1's physical database via multiple excel files, this project aims to migrate F1's data from a physical database into a cloud-based database. The cloud-based database we are using is Snowflake. 

This repository is for all the SQL codes our team has used for the migration of F1's data into Snowflake.

The repo folder here is purely used to test if the Snowflake and GitHub integration works, it is not related to any database code at all.
