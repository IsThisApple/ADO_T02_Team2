Grid Table:
1. **Key Definition**:  
  - Defined the purpose of symbols used in comments (`/` for joining and `-` for removing nulls).

2. **Created and Populated Table**:  
  - Created the `RAW3.F1_3.GRID_STATS` table.  
  - Joined data from `RAW3.F1_3.SPRINT_GRID` and `RAW3.F1_3.STARTING_GRIDS` based on matching `DRIVERCODE`, `YEAR`, and `GRAND_PRIX`.  
  - Selected specific fields from both tables to populate the new table.

3. **Cleaned Data**:  
  - Deleted rows from `RAW3.F1_3.GRID_STATS` where any key field (e.g., `STARTING_POS`, `NO`, `DRIVER`, etc.) was `NULL`.
  - Updated the `SPRINT_TIME` column to replace `NULL` values with `'N/A'`.

4. **Validated Data**:  
  - Verified the contents of `RAW3.F1_3.GRID_STATS` with `SELECT` queries after each step.

5. **Checked for Nulls**:  
  - Counted rows with `NULL` values in any key field to ensure data integrity after cleaning.
